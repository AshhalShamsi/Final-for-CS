PROJECT TITLE: Paper Toss Project

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To demonstrate a thorough knowledge of the concepts learned in AP
		    Computer Science as well as make an entertaining and functioning
		    game.

		    Secondary Goal: To prove we could use a 3D graphics engine and the
		    first-person movement of an object because itâ€™s cool.

VERSION or DATE: Final Project Version #1
		 Start Date: 07 May 2017
		 End Date: 24 May 2017

DEPENDENCIES: env3d Graphics Library

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Select the GraphiclessMenu Class, and start the main menu.
			   You can check out the instructions, look at the top 10 scores
			   for the game, play the game, or exit. Select play game to
			   play.

AUTHORS: Payton Schubel & Ashhal Shamsi

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Instructions are provided through the menu, however, the cliff notes
		   are as follows:

		   - Click esc to force the program to quit.
		   - Use WASD to move around.
		   - Use the mouse to turn
		   - While F1 does run the menu again, it does not superimpose the menu
		     over the game. You will have to minimize the game to view the menu.
		   - Click F3 to throw the ball.
		   - There are some little things throughout the game that will cause the
		     controls to behave differently than expected (for example, pressing
		     F2 will disengage the limit on your motion on the y axis). This was
		     for troubleshooting code, but since they can be kind of fun we
		     decided not to remove them. Just be aware that these were left
		     intentionally and are not glitches.
